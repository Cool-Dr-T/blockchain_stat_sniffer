# blockchain_stat_sniffer
A short and dirty script for pulling blockchain activity stats from various chains...

This is a very quick and dirty attempt to generate some blockchain stats from various projects:

1. Solana
2. Ethereum
3. Fantom
4. Polygon
5. Algorand

** more to be added - this is work in progress **

The idea here is that it grabs some basic use statistics from public APIs - we are using Infura and Quicknode here however \n
any node will do (your own one for example). These stats are pulled from the blockchains and stored in a database for easy \n
dashboarding.

You will need your own accounts with Infura and Quicknode for all except Solana - hopefully IOTA and Tezos are next on my list.

Please help support this effort (any help is appreciated) - it is not cheap to run lots of nodes...
